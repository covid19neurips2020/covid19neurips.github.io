                    <p>The COVID-19 global pandemic has disrupted nearly all aspects of modern life. This year NeurIPS
                        will host a symposium on COVID-19 to frame challenges and opportunities for the machine learning
                        community and to foster a frank discussion on the role of machine learning. A central focus of
                        this symposium will be clearly outlining key areas where machine learning is and is not likely
                        to make a substantive impact. The one-day event will feature talks from leading
                        epidemiologists, biotech leaders, policy makers, and global health experts. Attendees of this
                        symposium will gain a deeper understanding of the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic,
                        challenges and limitations for current machine learning capabilities, how machine learning is
                        accelerating COVID-19 vaccine development, and possible ways machine learning may aid in the
                        present and future pandemics.</p>

                                                and Princeton University to develop a Global Immunological Observatory
                                                (GIO) – a not-for-profit
                                                network of high throughput laboratories to monitor emerging and existing
                                                pathogens in the US and
                                                globally. The objective is to create a virus monitoring system that
                                                matches the weather forecasting
                                                systems in use globally today.

                                                Michael has been on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic since it
                                                began, helping to advise
                                                state, national, and international institutions and governments and has
                                                been instrumental in setting up
                                                high throughput COVID-19 testing programs at the Broad Institute of MIT
                                                and Harvard, where he is also
                                                an Associate Member. His research focuses on monitoring and tracking
                                                outbreaks of novel and seasonal
                                                viruses through the global population. His laboratory at the Harvard
                                                School of Public Health develops
                                                new technologies and statistical algorithms that measure the immune
                                                system response in fine detail and
                                                leverages immunological data to detect and forecast pathogen movement.

                                                I work at Google Medical Brain. I am also an Assistant Professor in
                                                Statistical Science at Duke University, where I also hold secondary
                                                appointments in Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering,
                                                Neurobiology, Neurology, and is affiliated with the Center for Cognitive
                                                Neuroscience and the Information Initiative at Duke. I received my PhD
                                                from the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL, and was a
                                                postdoc at the University of Cambridge on an EPSRC postdoc fellowship,
                                                and at MIT on an NSF postdoc fellowship. In terms of grants I am the
                                                recent recipient of a couple of Google faculty research awards, a first
                                                round BRAIN initiative award from the NSF, a CAREER, a DARPA lifelong
                                                learning award, and an ARI award for modeling teams. My PhD thesis work
                                                was on coming up with efficient ways to do Bayesian clustering. I did a
                                                bunch of work on nonparametric Bayes, social networks, and in
                                                computational cognitive science. I am currently interested in the
                                                combination of Bayesian statistics and deep neural networks, interacting
                                                dynamical techniques, and time series and network modeling in general. I
                                                apply the work that I do to problems in medicine and in social sciences.
                                                Here are a couple of my recent projects: 1) Using a combination of
                                                Gaussian Processes and Recurrent Neural Networks to predict whether a
                                                hospital patient is at risk for sepsis. This work has been deployed in
                                                the Emergency Department at Duke University Hospital. 2) I have used
                                                Gaussian Processes, Infinite Factor Models, and logistic regression to
                                                tackle other medical problems such as chronic kidney disease, and the
                                                prediction of surgical complications. 3) I developed an app to collect
                                                data on people with multiple sclerosis. The problem when you have any
                                                chronic illness is that you spend more time outside the medical system
                                                (where data might be collected) than in it, so this is an exploration of
                                                using mobile devices and other trackers to fill in the missing data. 4)
                                                I am using time series, stochastic Bayesian methods to model social
                                                networks, ranging from conversation networks (who is most influential in
                                                a controversial supreme court case?), to disease networks (is my friend
                                                likely to get me sick?), to Duke basketball team networks (how do we
                                                construct a winning basketball team?). On a personal level: I grew up in
                                                the Bronx, and in the northwest suburbs of NYC. I went to school on long
                                                island, and in Manhattan. I lived for a decade in the UK, a year each in
                                                Oxford and Cambridge, the rest of the time in London. Over a year in
                                                Boston, and, most recently, 6 years in North Carolina. I have two
                                                children, 4 and 6 years old.
